Image processing outline
-------------------------

edge detection -> houghlines -> filter viable lines(todo) -> clustering 2 lines 
-> convert to slope-intercept -> get y val at middle x and take middle as center point -> OUTPUT=CENTER_POINT


edge detection -> train for lines on edges as features -> sliding window to find line -> merge overlapping windows


System Architecture
-------------------

camera image -> image processing -> 


Topics to research

PID controller - AI4R???

Motor Control
-------------
MOTOR PWM - Only need to hook ground/signal to pi. NOT POWER
Set PWM Freq to 15% duty cycle of 100hz freq(15ms) hold down button, should go green->red. 
If not, do full throttle forward 20%(20ms), nuetral (15ms), backward (10ms). Nuetral when done
Should blink in between forward->reverse when ready
starts to move at ~15.6ms, speed does seem to respond to .1ms changes
Still think it will be too fast...
figure out how to get ESC into half speed mode?

STEERING SERVO - hook power/ground/signal to pi.
Powered by 5v line on pi, which is hooked up to Vin of pi.
15.1-20ms(over 15%) turns left
10-14.9ms turns right
responds to 0.1 increments
